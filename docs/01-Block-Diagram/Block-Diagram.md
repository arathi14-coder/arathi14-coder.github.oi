## Overview
The purpose of this block diagram is to illustrate the design and signal flow of a current monitoring and alert system using the Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano microcontroller.The system is powered through the Curiosity Nanoâ€™s regulated 5V USB supply, which also powers the connected sensors and output components.

Power Source:5V DC (via USB)  
Sensor: ACS712  
Actuators:LED, Buzzer  
Signal Processing: MCP6002 Op-Amp, ADC/DAC on PIC18F57Q43  
Communication:RX line to Connector 2 (digital/analog expansion)

## Block Diagram 
The following image shows my individual block diagram created for the EGR 304 project, illustrating the current sensing and alert system using the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano microcontroller.
