## Overview
The purpose of this block diagram is to illustrate the design and signal flow of a current monitoring and alert system using the Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano microcontroller.The system is powered through the Curiosity Nanoâ€™s regulated 5V USB supply, which also powers the connected sensors and output components.

Power Source:** 5V DC (via USB)  
**Sensor:** ACS712  
**Actuators:** LED, Buzzer  
**Signal Processing:** MCP6002 Op-Amp, ADC/DAC on PIC18F57Q43  
**Communication:** RX line to Connector 2 (digital/analog expansion)

To get some initial formatting help, one can view ["here"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/) some basic techniques.
